## Very Important Notes

- NEVER use --force
- keep your local repo in sync with the remote repo
- Write meaningful commit message (I might create a templete)
if you neeed to know anything about git I think [this is the best source](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)

## The WorkFlow
We are going to use what is called Feature Branch workflow. [Details here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

- create a feature branch of the master
- commit only working code
- test your code in the feature branch before merging it to master
